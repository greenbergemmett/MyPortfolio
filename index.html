                        <h3>Analyzing Building Permit Valuations to Understand Development Inequities in Boston</h3>
                        <p>
                            In this project, I used <b>R</b> to explore the <b>underlying drivers of building permit valuations across Boston neighborhoods</b>, with a focus on identifying differences between commercial and residential developments. The goal was to understand how development patterns—reflected in permit values—correlate with socioeconomic and infrastructural characteristics of local communities.
						    <br></br>
							This analysis involved a range of data science techniques, including data cleaning, spatial joins, dataset merging, and summarization. I also created maps to visualize spatial patterns in permit activity and conducted statistical inference through t-tests and multivariate linear regression. These methods helped isolate the impact of variables such as median household income, racial and ethnic composition, and access to public transportation on building permit values.
                            <br></br>
                            My key findings revealed that areas with higher income levels and better transit access tend to receive permits for higher-value developments, both residential and commercial. Conversely, lower permit values were more common in communities with higher proportions of residents of color and lower incomes. These disparities suggest uneven investment in Boston’s built environment, which can reinforce existing inequalities in access to quality housing, economic opportunity, and services.
                            <br></br>
                            This project highlights the importance of equitable urban development. The ability to quantify and visualize these disparities using multivariate analysis has implications for public policy and planning—particularly in targeting resources to support affordable housing and small business growth in historically underinvested areas.

                        <h3>Mapping Pedestrian Safety in Environmental Justice Communities in Boston</h3>
                        <p>
                            This project leveraged <b>ArcGIS Pro</b> to investigate the relationship between pedestrian safety and

                                target="_blank" 
                                >
                                environmental justice (EJ) indicators
                            </a>
                             across Boston neighborhoods. The primary objective was to explore whether residents in EJ-designated block groups—defined by factors such as low income, high minority populations, and limited English proficiency—face disproportionate risks related to pedestrian infrastructure and traffic safety.
                             <br></br>
                             I integrated and analyzed multiple spatial datasets, including pedestrian crash locations (sourced from MassDOT), reported sidewalk quality issues, and public safety concern reports. Using spatial joins, I aggregated these variables at the census block group level and linked them with EJ criteria from the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. This allowed me to identify patterns in pedestrian crashes, infrastructure quality, and reported concerns in relation to neighborhood demographics.
                            <br></br>
                            The maps and spatial summaries I created revealed a moderate negative correlation between sidewalk quality and pedestrian crashes—suggesting that areas with poorer pedestrian infrastructure may be more prone to crashes. However, crash counts did not show a strong correlation with income levels alone, indicating that unsafe conditions may be widespread and not exclusively concentrated in low-income areas.
                            <br></br>
                            Based on these findings, I recommend that the City of Boston prioritize targeted infrastructure improvements in EJ communities, where sidewalk quality issues often overlap with historically underinvested areas. These improvements could include repairing or replacing damaged sidewalks, widening pedestrian pathways, and introducing dedicated infrastructure such as pedestrian bridges, footpaths, and ADA-compliant ramps.
                            <br></br>
                            To further enhance pedestrian safety, the city could implement traffic calming interventions like raised crosswalks, speed humps, daylighting intersections, and pedestrian refuge islands. Importantly, these efforts should be guided by community engagement: listening to residents’ lived experiences, conducting localized traffic studies, and observing driver and pedestrian behavior can help ensure that interventions are responsive to neighborhood-specific needs.
                            <br></br>
                            This project highlights the <b>potential of spatial analysis to inform more equitable urban planning and transportation safety policies</b> — particularly in communities that have historically been overlooked in infrastructure investments.

                        <h3>Visualizing the Impact of COVID-19 on Traffic Patterns in Massachusetts</h3>
                        <p>
                            In this project, I used <b>R</b> to examine how traffic patterns across Massachusetts changed from 2019 to 2020, with a particular focus on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing statewide traffic data, I explored shifts in vehicle speeds and the frequency of car accidents across various road types—including interstates, arterials, and local roads.
			            <br></br>
                        To uncover trends and outliers, I created boxplots that visualized the distribution of both speed and accident counts across road categories. These visualizations provided a clear snapshot of how driving behaviors and safety outcomes evolved during a period of significant social disruption and reduced travel demand.
                        <br></br>
                        Building on the R analysis, I used <b>Canva</b> to design an engaging infographic that communicated the key findings in an accessible and impactful way. The infographic highlighted the Massachusetts communities that experienced the greatest increases in traffic accidents in 2020, alongside road-type-specific trends and a visual summary of the correlation between speed and crash rates.
                        <br></br>
                        One of the most striking findings was that, despite an overall decrease in traffic volume and accidents statewide, local roads experienced a modest but notable increase — averaging approximately two additional crashes per road segment in 2020 compared to 2019. These <b>local roads also saw an average increase in vehicle speed of 4.68 mph</b>, suggesting that lower congestion may have contributed to riskier driving behaviors in neighborhood settings.
                        <br></br>
                        This project demonstrates how data visualization and statistical analysis can be used to uncover hidden patterns in public safety data. It also underscores the importance of closely monitoring local roads during periods of major societal change, when reduced enforcement and altered mobility patterns may unintentionally increase crash risk in residential areas.
